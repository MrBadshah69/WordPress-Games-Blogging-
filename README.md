# WordPress Games Blogging Website Setup on Localhost

This repository provides instructions for setting up a WordPress-based games blogging website on your local machine using XAMPP. Follow these steps to get your WordPress site up and running locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **XAMPP**: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, which includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
- **WordPress**: The content management system (CMS) used for building the blogging website.
- **A Code Editor**: Optional but recommended for customizing your WordPress site.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Install XAMPP

1. Go to the [XAMPP official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### 2. Set Up XAMPP

1. Launch XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

### 3. Download WordPress

1. Go to the [WordPress official website](https://wordpress.org/download/) and download the latest version of WordPress.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.

### 4. Create a Database

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
2. Click on the **Databases** tab and create a new database for your WordPress site. Name it something relevant, e.g., `games_blog`.

### 5. Set Up WordPress

1. Move the extracted WordPress files to the `htdocs` directory inside your XAMPP installation directory. The path should look like `C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress`.
2. Rename the `wp-config-sample.php` file to `wp-config.php`.
3. Open `wp-config.php` in your code editor and update the following lines with your database information:

    ```php
    define('DB_NAME', 'games_blog');
    define('DB_USER', 'root');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
    define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
    ```

4. Save the `wp-config.php` file.

### 6. Run the WordPress Installation

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/wordpress`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the WordPress installation. You will be asked to provide a site title, username, password, and email address.

### 7. Access Your WordPress Dashboard

1. After installation, log in to your WordPress admin dashboard by going to `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin`.
2. Use the username and password you set during the installation process.

## Additional Configuration

- **Themes and Plugins**: Customize your site by installing themes and plugins from the WordPress dashboard.
- **Database Management**: Manage your siteâ€™s database via `phpMyAdmin` at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
- **Local Development**: Use XAMPP for local development and testing before deploying to a live server.

## Troubleshooting

- **Apache/MySQL Not Starting**: Check if other applications are using the same ports (e.g., port 80 for Apache). You can change the ports in XAMPP Control Panel.
- **Database Connection Error**: Ensure that the database credentials in `wp-config.php` match those in phpMyAdmin.
